# crias

Crias is meant to be a lightweight wrapper around the LLM workflow. It is meant to make working with LLMs easier. Over time, it will provide a set of simple abstractions over:

- LLMs - allowing easy choosing between LLM providers.
- Prompts - managing templates and libraries.
- Output formatters - coercing LLM output into a particular format.
- Evaluators - helping evaluate and score LLM outputs.

## Installation

```bash
pip install crias
```
